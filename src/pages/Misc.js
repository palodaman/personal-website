        I try to keep myself off the radar of social media to be able to tend to my more fulfilling proclivities, like reading. Reading, I believe, is a free source of entertainment, good for edification of your mind. I mostly read while commuting or before going to bed.
          I got myself an e-reader recently and it has been a game changer for me. Reading has become more convenient and accessible. </p>
        <p>Following is a list of books, in no particular order, that I have read and/or re-read in 2022, and they have been amazing reads.</p>
